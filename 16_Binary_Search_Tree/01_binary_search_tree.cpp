// For every node, keys in left side are smaller and keys in right side ar greater
// all keys are typically considered as distinct.
// like linked list , it is a linked list data structure.
// implemented in C++ as map, set, multimap and multiset.
// Time complexity for search, insert and delete is O(h) where h is height of the tree
// Space complexity is O(h) due to recursive call stack.
// Space complexity can be O(n) in case of skewed tree.
