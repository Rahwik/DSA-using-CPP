//BInary Heap Tree
// Binary Heap Tree

// A binary heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is either greater than (max heap) or less than (min heap) its children.

// Structure of a Binary Heap
//        10
//       /  \
//      8    12
//     / \   / \
//    5   9 11  15

// Types of Binary Heaps:
// 1. Max Heap: In a max heap, the parent node is greater than its children.
// 2. Min Heap: In a min heap, the parent node is less than its children.

// Binary Heap Operations:
// 1. Insertion: Inserting a new element into the heap.
// 2. Deletion: Deleting an element from the heap.
// 3. Extraction: Extracting the maximum or minimum element from the heap.

// Binary Heap Formulas:
// 1. Height of a Binary Heap: log(n)
// 2. Number of nodes in a Binary Heap: n
// 3. Number of leaves in a Binary Heap: n/2
// 4. Left Child: 2*i + 1
// 5. Right Child: 2*i + 2
// 6. Parent Node: (i-1)/2

// Example of a Binary Heap:
// Suppose we have the following elements: 10, 8, 12, 5, 9, 11, 15
// We can create a max heap as follows:

//        15
//       /  \
//      12   10
//     / \   / \
//    9   11 8  5
