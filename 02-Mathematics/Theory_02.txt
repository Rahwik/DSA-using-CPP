-Arithmetic and Geometric progessions:

 2,4,6,8,...............

 a=2 First elelment(FT)                       avg=sum/n                       =n/2[a+(a+(n-1)d)]
 d=2 difference                               sum=avg/n
 a+d                                          sum=((FT+LT)/2)*n               =n/2[2a+(n-1)d]
 a+2d
 .

 .
 a+(n-1)d last elelment(LT)

 -Quadratic Equations:

               ax^2+bx+c=0

 D=b^2-4a*c                    x = -b +- sqrt(b^2-4ac)/2a

D<0,imaginary roots
D=0,two equal roots
D>0, teo distinct roots

-Permuataion and Combinational Basics:

Permuataion: Permuataionis defined as arrangement of r thingd that can be done out of total n things.
this is denoted by nPr which is qual to : n!(n-r)!

Combinational: Combinational is defined as selection of r things that can be done out of total n things
this is denoted by nCr which is equal to n!r!(n-r)!
