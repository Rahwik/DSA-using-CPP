A function calling itself directly or indirectly is called recursion.


(Direct Method)
void fun1()
{
    .........
    .........
    fun1();
    .........
    .........
}

(Indirect method)
void fun1()
{
    .........
    .........
    fun2();
    .........
    .........
}
void fun2()
{
    .........
    .........
    fun1();
    .........
    .........
}

-Application of Recursion.

1.Many Algorithm technologiesare based on Recursion:

*Dynamic Programming
*BackTracking
*Divide and Conquer(Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)

2.Many problems inherently recursive:

*Tower Hanoi
*DFS based traversals(DFS of graph and Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Traversal of tree)

-Tail recursion:

Tail recursion is a special form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function.
This means that there are no pending operations to be performed after the recursive call returns.
Tail recursion is important because it allows some compilers to optimize the recursive function calls,
reducing the risk of stack overflow and improving performance.
